# Worked Out Example
## Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)
A four-point NTT structure with **Ïˆ** = 1925 in the ring **Z**<sub>7681</sub> is considered. A Cooley-Tukey butterfly unit based fast-NTT requires log<sub>2</sub>(n) stages. This implies our example shall need 2 stages\

Note: Inputs are in Normal order, Outputs are in Bit-reversed Order

## Inverse Number Theoretic Transform (INTT)
Likewise a four-point INTT structure based on Gentleman-Sande Butterfly units shall require 2 stages\
